### 👋Hi, I'm Andrei Jakab
I'm a technical and people leader with a 10-year track record of success in the medical device industry. Throughout my career, I've worked on complex instruments that combined embedded systems, software, and mechanical parts. 

Here is a snapshot of the successful medical devices that I've worked on:
- [sqidlite™ and sqid-X™ instruments](https://sqidiagnostics.com/systems/) 
- [MOVES® SLC™](https://thornhillmedical.com/products/moves-slc/)
- [MADM™](https://thornhillmedical.com/products/madm/)
- [MyndMove™](https://www.myndtec.com/clinicians/product-information/)

The goal of this Github profile is to showcase my development skills. The software & firmware contained in the devices listed above is proprietary so I can't include it here (although I can definitely talk about it, so don't hesitate to ask 😄). Instead, you'll find the following types of projects:
- software & firmware that I wrote during my university years
- coursework for ongoing/completed classes that I'm using to sharpen the saw

Writing code runs within my genes. My dad taught me QBasic when I was 10 and my skills have only progressed since. Let's talk about how I can make your next project a success!
